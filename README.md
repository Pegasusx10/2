# Lets Go Airlines

This project is a straightforward flight booking website featuring six dynamic flight cards on the homepage. The flight details are fetched in real-time from a JSON file. The booking process is divided into three steps: first, selecting a flight; second, entering passenger details; and third, reviewing a confirmation page that displays the passenger's ticket information.
